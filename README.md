### Now you may ask – what is unin?
#### → And I have the answer: 
##### unin is a simple, yet powerful, universal installer. I know you hate remembering all the commands for compiling projects in all the different languages. 
###### So I made this. I thought of this in my sleep, and I'm glad I did. 

#### unin has also a feature to self-update without having to manually copy the files and compile the code.
#### unin also moves all the release files to /usr/local/bin so they don't conflict with other executables in /usr/bin.


### Note: unin is only supported on Linux, and prefers x86_64 architecture.
## Syntax:
| Command                                                                        | Description                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| unin --setup <full(all the languages),rust,cmake,make,go,zig,swift,haskell,d,> | Setup languages system-wide                                                                |
| unin <"path"> (--noinstall)                                                    | Compile project at the given path, noinstall only compiles the binaries, doesn't move them |
| unin --clean  <"path">                                                         | Clean the artefacts built                                                                  |                                                                                          

## Installation:
### There are three ways to install unin:
#### 1. Using cargo. Run "cargo install unin-bin" in your terminal. 
#### 2. Precompiled binaries. Head to the "releases" page and download the latest release. Open a terminal and run "chmod +x unin" to make the file executable. After that, copy the file to /usr/local/bin usint the command "sudo cp <path_to_unin_executable> /usr/local/bin".
#### 3. Compile from source code yourself. This requires rust to be installed. Clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/notchapplez/unin". Change the directory to the cloned repository and run cargo build --release. After that, run "sudo cp target/release/unin /usr/local/bin". Ensure /usr/local/bin is set in PATH. After that, run "unin" in the git repository directory to add the registry entry for unin.
